# 🚀 Mastering TypeScript: Deep Dive into Advanced Concepts

Welcome to this **mini TypeScript guide**! If you're looking to level up your TypeScript knowledge or want to brush up on advanced concepts, this readme covers some of the most important topics with real-world examples.

## 🆚 Interface vs Type — What's the Difference?

Both `interface` and `type` are used to define the shape of an object, but there are subtle differences:

| Feature           | `interface`                          | `type`                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Extending        | Can be extended using `extends` or `implements` | Can use intersections (`&`) for composition |
| Merging          | Automatically merges declarations    | Cannot merge; re-declaration causes error |
| Usage Flexibility| Only for object shapes               | Can represent primitives, unions, tuples, etc. |

**Example:**
```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

type Admin = {
  role: string;
};
````

We can also combine both:

```ts
interface SuperUser extends User, Admin {}
```

---

## 🔑 Using `keyof` in TypeScript

The `keyof` keyword creates a union of all property names of a given type.

**Example:**

```ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type PersonKeys = keyof Person; // "name" | "age"
```

Used for **dynamic property access** with type safety:

```ts
function getProperty<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K): T[K] {
  return obj[key];
}
```

## 🤯 `any` vs `unknown` vs `never`

| Type      | Description                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `any`     | Turns off type checking — use with caution!                                           |
| `unknown` | Safe version of `any` — we must check the type before using it                       |
| `never`   | Represents values that **never occur** (e.g., a function that always throws an error) |

**Examples:**

```ts
let valueAny: any = "hello";
valueAny.foo(); // No error 😬

let valueUnknown: unknown = "hello";
// valueUnknown.foo(); ❌ Error — must check type

function fail(): never {
  throw new Error("Something went wrong");
}
```

## 🎯 Enums — Define Named Constants

Enums provide a way to define a set of named constants.

### ✅ Numeric Enum

```ts
enum Status {
  Pending,
  InProgress,
  Completed,
}

const taskStatus: Status = Status.InProgress;
```

### ✅ String Enum

```ts
enum Direction {
  North = "NORTH",
  South = "SOUTH",
  East = "EAST",
  West = "WEST",
}

const travel: Direction = Direction.East;
```

---

## 🧠 Type Inference — Let TypeScript Do the Thinking

TypeScript can automatically infer the type of a variable based on its value.

**Example:**

```ts
let count = 42; // inferred as number
```

### Why It's Helpful:

* Reduces boilerplate
* Improves readability
* Maintains type safety

---

## 💡 How TypeScript Improves Code Quality

* ✅ **Early Error Detection**: Catches bugs during development.
* ✅ **Better IntelliSense**: Enhanced autocompletion and suggestions.
* ✅ **Self-Documenting Code**: Types describe what your code expects.
* ✅ **Refactoring is Safer**: IDEs can safely rename variables, update interfaces, etc.
* ✅ **Collaboration is Easier**: Your team understands contracts and expectations more clearly.

## ⚔️ Union vs Intersection Types

### ➕ Union (`|`)

A variable can be **one of many types**.

```ts
type Response = "success" | "error";
let result: Response = "success";
```

### 🔗 Intersection (`&`)

A variable must satisfy **all combined types**.

```ts
type User = { name: string };
type Admin = { role: string };

type AdminUser = User & Admin;

const admin: AdminUser = {
  name: "Alice",
  role: "Manager"
};
```

## 📌 Final Thoughts

TypeScript is not just a language—it’s a **developer superpower**. By leveraging strong typing, inference, enums, and more, your code becomes **cleaner, safer, and easier to maintain**.
